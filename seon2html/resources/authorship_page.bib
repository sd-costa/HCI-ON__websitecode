abstract = {This paper presents the version 2.0 of SABiO - a Systematic Aproach for Building Ontologies. SABiO focus on the development of domain ontologies, and propose also support and management processes, which are strongly linked to the development process. SABiO distinguishes between reference and operational ontologies, providing activities that apply to the development of both types of domain ontologies.},

@inproceedings{brank2005,
abstract = {An ontology is an explicit formal conceptualization of some domain of interest. Ontologies are increasingly used in various fields such as knowledge management, information extraction, and the semantic web. Ontology evaluation is the problem of assessing a given ontology from the point of view of a particular criterion of application, typically in order to determine which of several ontologies would best suit a particular purpose. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art in ontology evaluation.},
